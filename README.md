IRC Client with a Turtle UI

```
GOALS:
- [required] IRC client using Turtle Graphics as a UI.
- [required] Input
- [likely] configuration (steal from https://github.com/ShrugShoulders/RudeChat)
- [maybe] toggleable panels for channels and users?
- [unlikely] colour customisations (turning control codes into hex values)

TODO: 
- get text wrapping
- get text reading from a sample text file
- dev the client (steal from https://github.com/bl4de/irc-client)
